#### Potential project topics & questions

1. Population : This is a very broad topic and has several aspects associated with it. When thinking about population, I think of the several ways in which we classify and categorize population in order to quantify it- gender, age, class, ethnicity. Some of the questions that may arise with reference to population are how it impacts the environment, use of resources, economy, immigration policies?
         
2. Sustainability- plastic use- Sustainability is something I am passionate about and interested in. The use of plastics and their impact on the environment can be associated with many questions- how can we replace plastic? How can the existing accumulation of plastic be dealt with? What are the future implications of plastic use?

3. Cigarette smoking- This topic is interesting to me because I am constantly surrounded by people that smoke and despite knowing the consequences of it, continue to do so. Smoking is also one of the greatest causes of negative health impacts and diseases such as cancer. It also contributes to the generation of waste. If people were more aware of the statistics regarding the consequences, would they be convinced to stop? What are the most common reasons for smoking? To what extent does smoking contribute to environmental pollution? Is placing a ban on cigarette smoking a viable solution? 

4. Gender gap- in professions - The gender gap can be associated with several topics such as the pay gap, career opportunities, education, politics, the rise of feminism, etc. How does the data regarding the gender gap relate to other topics such as the economy, population growth? What changes may be observed in other aspects of the world if the gender gap is reduced?

5. Use of chemicals in daily life- I read an interesting article regarding this topic and it is extremely intriguing to know just how many different kinds of potentially dangerous chemicals we are exposed to in our daily lives. Where do these chemicals come from? How do they enter our bodies? Are they all potentially harmful? How can the scale of their presence in our bodies be compared to their presence in the atmosphere/environment?

6. Animal extinction rates- This is an extremely pressing issue and there are several causes and implications associated with it. The extinction of animal species is closely related to human activities, climate change and loss of habitat. What are the most significant and serious causes of rising extinction rates? How do scientists decide which species to conserve? How will the extinction of species of animals impact humans in the long-run?


7. Sleep - Sleep can be associated with several aspects of oneâ€™s life and there is a lot of information on the internet regarding this subject. Sleep patterns, productivity, behavioral traits, health related issues, sleep disorders are some of the related topics. What impact do sleep disorders and lack of sleep have on the overall health and productivity of people?

8. Social media use- The use of social media has grown in the last few years and has several impacts on the lives and lifestyles of people across the world. Some related topics include impacts of social media on children, adults and their social lives, behavioral influences, eating habits, social attitudes, connections with people, etc. It would be interesting to research how the accessibility to social media impacts different people living in different geographical areas or how social media connects to capitalism?

9. War - In the history of this world, war has caused much damage to people in general. The term war can be used broadly but includes any form of conflict that resulted in a serious disagreement between two parties that escalated to a form of physical or verbal battle. How much of what has been lost during wars in the past? What are the quantifiable and non-quantifiable damages? How have wars impacted the economy? 

10. Movies/Media- Movies, TV shows and other forms of media have a significant impact on their audience. What kind of problematic content is most often displayed in movies and TV shows? Related topics include profits of the industry, objectification of women in media, different genres, cultural appropriation, etc.
