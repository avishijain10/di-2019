## Process

SVG1: All countries atmospheric
This chart uses a column chart to show the atmospheric nuclear tests in all of the 8 countries. It is evident from the chart that countries with greater economic power such as US, USSR and France were able to conduct a much larger number of tests than any of the other countries. It is also evident that with the introduction of underground tests, atmospheric tests gradually ceased.

SVG2: All countries total
This chart uses a line graph to depict the total number of tests in each of the countries. It is clear from this chart that as more countries such as France, UK and China also started testing, competition for USA and USSR increased and these countries began to test more extensively. It also shows the years in which the testing numbers were the largest for all of the countries and the trends depict the impact of the treaties and the countries' compliance with them.

SVG3: USA AND USSR atmospheric and underground
This chart uses a line graph to depict the underground and atmospheric tests for 2 of the biggest nuclear powers. The trends depcit the hostilities between the two countries with the progress of the cold war as well as how the increase in tests in one country also trigerred an increase in the other.The chart also depicts the increase in underground tests as the number of atmospheric tests reduced.

SVG4: USA, USSR, UK and France (atmospheric and underground)
This chart uses a line graph to show the atmospheric and underground tests in USA, USSR, UK and France- the countries that conducted the larger percentage of the total tests. The chart shows the consequent increase in tests in countries with the increase in any one and also how USA and USSR increased the number of tests as France and UK started testing. 

Sketch1: This sketch shows atmospheric and underground tests over the years in all of the 8 countries using a bar chart. It sums up the total underground and atmospheric tests in each country but does not show a timeline.

Sketch2: This chart uses rectangles of different colors to depict the underground and atmospheric tests in different countries over the years. Each rectangle represents a test and rectangles on either side of the lines represent underground and atmospheric tests individually for each country. Time has been plotted on the x-axis and the countries on the y-axis. The treaties have been depicted using lines drawn across the corresponding year.

Sketch 3: In this chart, each concentric ellipse represents a decade starting from 1945 from the outside because the number of tests decrease as we reach the centre. The tests for each country are depcited using colored nuke icons and the upside down icons represent underground tests. 

Additional Information to add to charts
I want to include the environmental and health impacts of the nuclear testing in the countries as the additional data set for my charts. I want to examine in particluar the release of radionuclides and radiocarbons in the atmosphere and the increase in different types of cancer due to the same. I also wanted to consider looking particularly into the increase in health impacts in and around the areas near NTS or the Nevada Testing Site because this was one of the most important and most used testing sites in the US.
