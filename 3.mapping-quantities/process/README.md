## Process

SVG1: All countries atmospheric
This chart uses a column chart to show the atmospheric nuclear tests in all of the 8 countries. It is evident from the chart that countries with greater economic power such as US, USSR and France were able to conduct a much larger number of tests than any of the other countries. It is also evident that with the introduction of underground tests, atmospheric tests gradually ceased.

SVG2: All countries total
This chart uses a line graph to depict the total number of tests in each of the countries. It is clear from this chart that as more countries such as France, UK and China also started testing, competition for USA and USSR increased and these countries began to test more extensively. It also shows the years in which the testing numbers were the largest for all of the countries and the trends depict the impact of the treaties and the countries' compliance with them.

SVG3: USA AND USSR atmospheric and underground
This chart uses a line graph to depict the underground and atmospheric tests for 2 of the biggest nuclear powers. The trends depcit the hostilities between the two countries with the progress of the cold war as well as how the increase in tests in one country also trigerred an increase in the other.The chart also depicts the increase in underground tests as the number of atmospheric tests reduced.

SVG4: USA, USSR, UK and France (atmospheric and underground)
This chart uses a line graph to show the atmospheric and underground tests in USA, USSR, UK and France- the countries that conducted the larger percentage of the total tests. The chart shows the consequent increase in tests in countries with the increase in any one and also how USA and USSR increased the number of tests as France and UK started testing. 

Sketch1: This sketch shows atmospheric and underground tests over the years in all of the 8 countries using a bar chart. It sums up the total underground and atmospheric tests in each country but does not show a timeline.

Sketch2: This chart uses rectangles of different colors to depict the underground and atmospheric tests in different countries over the years. Each rectangle represents a test and rectangles on either side of the lines represent underground and atmospheric tests individually for each country. Time has been plotted on the x-axis and the countries on the y-axis. The treaties have been depicted using lines drawn across the corresponding year.

Sketch 3: In this chart, each concentric ellipse represents a decade starting from 1945 from the outside because the number of tests decrease as we reach the centre. The tests for each country are depcited using colored nuke icons and the upside down icons represent underground tests. 

Additional Information to add to charts
I want to include the environmental and health impacts of the nuclear testing in the countries as the additional data set for my charts. I want to examine in particluar the release of radionuclides and radiocarbons in the atmosphere and the increase in different types of cancer due to the same. I also wanted to consider looking particularly into the increase in health impacts in and around the areas near NTS or the Nevada Testing Site because this was one of the most important and most used testing sites in the US.

Sketch4: In this sketch, I have used plotted line graphs to incorporate the additional information which is the increase in cancer rates in the four greatest nuclear powers- USA, Russia, France and UK from 1950 to 2017. The colors represent the 4 different countries and the line graphs also depict the original data whuch is the total number of nuclear tests in each country from 1945 to 2017.

Sketch5: In this version, I have incorporated the line graphs representing the cancer rate increase data with one of my previous sketches that uses rectangles to show the number of nuclear tests in each country.

Sketch6: In this version, the line graphs showing the increase in cancer rates in the 4 countries are incorporated with stacked bar graphs that depict the number of nuclear tests in the 4 most important nuclear powers.

Week 10

Sketch 1: All countries tests and Cancer rates
 In these graphs, I have intended to show the total number of tests in each of the eight nuclear countries and the total yield from these tests. I have then added my additional data set of the cancer rates in each of these countries from 1990 to 2017 in order to show the correlation between the nuclear fallout from the testing and the increase in cancer rates.

Sketch 2: USA Tests and Cancer rates
In my second set of graphs, I have focussed on nuclear testing only in the United States. The first graph represents the atmospheric and underground tests in the United States alone. The secong graph depicts the gradual increase and decrease in cancer rates for different cancer types within the US, most of which are a result of nuclear fallout and are caused due to the accumulation of radioactive isotopes released duuring nuclear explosions. The last graph depicts the deposition of different radioactive isotopes released during the nuclear explosions. The quantity of depositions in the NTS in US has been compared to the global deposi
