Final combination of clock and calendar time

In this representation of clock and calender time, the rotating arcs of green, yellow and blue color represent hours, minutes and seconds respectively. These arcs are placed on a circle that changes color based on the days of the week. Each day of the week is depicted using a different color. The arcs and the circle together rotate around another circle to represent the completion of the week and with every 4 rotations, the radius of the inner blue-green circle increases to show increments in the months of the year. This circle also rotates around the centre of the canvas to depict the completion of a year with its radius increasing by the month. The triangle in the centre depicts the 4 seasons as it rotates along the centre and changes values of color for each season. Therefore, I have tried to use different retinal variables such as size, color, position and value to depict changes in hours, minutes, seconds, days, weeks, months and seasons of the year.
